# ai-native-skills

Reusable agent skills and workflows for AI-native engineering. Works with any agent that supports the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) standard — Hermes, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Windsurf, and 30+ others.

**80 skills · 9 workflows · 6 meta-skills**

See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md) for the canonical taxonomy of `skill`, `workflow`, `meta-skill`, and the adapter pattern. See [docs/facade-skill-pattern.md](docs/facade-skill-pattern.md) for facade skills that expose one stable entry point while delegating specialist knowledge. See [docs/ai-native-engineering-building-blocks.md](docs/ai-native-engineering-building-blocks.md) for coverage across Agent, Model, Methodology, Spec, and Context. See [docs/skill-packs.md](docs/skill-packs.md) for one-command bundle installs. Skill files follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification); repo-specific fields live under namespaced `metadata` keys.

## Install

```bash
# Single skill
npx skills add puterakahfi/ai-native-skills@<skill-name> -g -y

# Examples
npx skills add puterakahfi/ai-native-skills@workflow-router -g -y
npx skills add puterakahfi/ai-native-skills@brand-identity-review -g -y
npx skills add puterakahfi/ai-native-skills@ai-system-design -g -y

# Full suite
npx skills add puterakahfi/ai-native-skills -g -y
```

> **Installing a workflow?** Workflows depend on other skills — use the packs in [docs/skill-packs.md](docs/skill-packs.md) to install a workflow + all its dependencies in one command. The Agent Skills spec has no native dependency resolution yet; packs bridge the gap.

## Hermes Profile Bootstrap

Use `hermes-profile-bootstrap` when Hermes is already installed and you want to create a ready-to-use AI-native engineering profile skeleton.

Install the bootstrap skill into Hermes:

```bash
npx --yes skills add puterakahfi/ai-native-skills \
  --skill hermes-profile-bootstrap \
  --agent hermes-agent \
  --global \
  --yes
```

Then ask Hermes to bootstrap the profile:

```bash
hermes chat -s hermes-profile-bootstrap -q \
  "Bootstrap the ai-native-engineering profile using the engineering preset. Create the complete skeleton and verify that required skills, workflows, and meta-skills exist."
```

What it creates/checks:

- `SOUL.md`, `skills.lock.yaml`, bootstrap docs, install/verify scripts, and `.gitignore`
- required meta-skills: `workflow-router`, `role-switcher`
- required workflows: `product-development-workflow`, `spec-workflow`, `new-feature-workflow`, `bugfix-workflow`, `code-review-workflow`, `deployment-workflow`
- required Native AI, engineering quality, and architecture foundation skills
- correct `metadata["ai-native-skills.type"]` for meta-skills and workflows
- no secrets, credentials, or live Hermes state in the reusable skeleton

One-shot mode without installing the skill permanently:

```bash
hermes chat -q "$(npx --yes skills use puterakahfi/ai-native-skills@hermes-profile-bootstrap)

Bootstrap the ai-native-engineering profile using the engineering preset. Verify required skill packs before claiming done."
```

This is a Hermes adapter skill for the runtime-agnostic profile-bootstrap contract in [`ai-native-core`](https://github.com/puterakahfi/ai-native-core). It is not a standalone `hermes-generate` binary yet.

## Skill Type Taxonomy

`ai-native-skills` uses three official category values under `metadata["ai-native-skills.type"]`. See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md) for definitions, decision rules, and the adapter pattern.

| Type | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `skill` | Atomic capability — standalone, reusable domain capability or expert lens | `systematic-debugging`, `brand-identity-review` |
| `workflow` | Sequenced phases — lifecycle with gates, often composing skills | `bugfix-workflow`, `redesign-workflow` |
| `meta-skill` | Router/composer — selects workflows or skill combinations before execution | `role-switcher`, `workflow-router` |

`facade` and `domain-reviewer` are patterns, not additional official types. Both remain `type: skill` while declaring their pattern and contract.

---

## Meta-Skills (6)

Load these first — they route and compose everything else.

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `workflow-router` | Separates product, audit, refinement, redesign, bug, feature, review, deploy, and learning routes before execution |
| `role-switcher` | Composes one owner, narrow specialists, a reviewer facade, and domain reviewers when specialized acceptance is required |
| `design-layout` | Layout & structure port — routes to macrostructures, responsiveness, ui-components |
| `design-visual` | Visual design port — routes to genre, motion, composition, readability |
| `design-strategy` | UX strategy & content port — routes to ux-psychology, information-architecture, cro, copywriting |
| `design-interaction` | Interaction & UX patterns port — routes to ux-ui-patterns, ux-patterns-for-developers |

---

## Workflows (9)

## Adapter and Facade Patterns

A facade remains `type: skill`:

```yaml
name: design-review
metadata:
  ai-native-skills.type: skill
  ai-native-skills.pattern: facade
```

A domain reviewer also remains `type: skill`:

```yaml
name: brand-identity-review
metadata:
  ai-native-skills.type: skill
  ai-native-skills.pattern: domain-reviewer
  ai-native-skills.implements: ai-native-core/contracts/skills/quality/brand-identity-review.contract.yaml
```

The facade owns routing, canonical identity, evidence normalization, scoring, coverage, verdict, and report. The domain reviewer owns specialist gate definitions, evidence interpretation, hard gates, and professional boundaries.

---

## Skill Evaluation

Regression cases live under `contracts/tests/<skill>.test.yaml`.

```bash
python ai-native-core/scripts/run-eval.py \
  --skill brand-identity-review \
  --output-dir eval-outputs
```

Design regressions cover routing, evidence limits, static fidelity, presentation strategy, canonical gate identity, identity construction/variant/small-size failures, adapter coverage, and similarity-screening legal boundaries.
