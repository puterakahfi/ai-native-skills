# ai-native-skills

Reusable agent skills and workflows for AI-native engineering. Works with any agent that supports the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) standard — Hermes, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Windsurf, and 30+ others.

**79 skills · 9 workflows · 6 meta-skills**

See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md) for the canonical taxonomy of `skill`, `workflow`, `meta-skill`, and the adapter pattern. See [docs/ai-native-engineering-building-blocks.md](docs/ai-native-engineering-building-blocks.md) for coverage across Agent, Model, Methodology, Spec, and Context. Skill files follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification); repo-specific fields live under namespaced `metadata` keys.

## Hermes Profile Bootstrap

Use `hermes-profile-bootstrap` when Hermes is already installed and you want to create a ready-to-use AI-native engineering profile skeleton.

Install the bootstrap skill into Hermes:

```bash
npx --yes skills add puterakahfi/ai-native-skills \
  --skill hermes-profile-bootstrap \
  --agent hermes-agent \
  --global \
  --yes
```

Then ask Hermes to bootstrap the profile:

```bash
hermes chat -s hermes-profile-bootstrap -q \
  "Bootstrap the ai-native-engineering profile using the engineering preset. Create the complete skeleton and verify that required skills, workflows, and meta-skills exist."
```

What it creates/checks:

- `SOUL.md`, `skills.lock.yaml`, bootstrap docs, install/verify scripts, and `.gitignore`
- required meta-skills: `workflow-router`, `role-switcher`
- required workflows: `product-development-workflow`, `spec-workflow`, `new-feature-workflow`, `bugfix-workflow`, `code-review-workflow`, `deployment-workflow`
- required Native AI, engineering quality, and architecture foundation skills
- correct `metadata["ai-native-skills.type"]` for meta-skills and workflows
- no secrets, credentials, or live Hermes state in the reusable skeleton

One-shot mode without installing the skill permanently:

```bash
hermes chat -q "$(npx --yes skills use puterakahfi/ai-native-skills@hermes-profile-bootstrap)

Bootstrap the ai-native-engineering profile using the engineering preset. Verify required skill packs before claiming done."
```

This is a Hermes adapter skill for the runtime-agnostic profile-bootstrap contract in [`ai-native-core`](https://github.com/puterakahfi/ai-native-core). It is not a standalone `hermes-generate` binary yet.

## Skill Type Taxonomy

`ai-native-skills` uses three official category values under `metadata["ai-native-skills.type"]`. See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md) for definitions, decision rules, and the adapter pattern.

| Type | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `skill` | Atomic capability — standalone, reusable domain capability or expert lens | `systematic-debugging`, `threat-modeling` |
| `workflow` | Sequenced phases — lifecycle with gates, often composing skills | `bugfix-workflow`, `redesign-workflow` |
| `meta-skill` | Router/composer — selects workflows or skill combinations before execution | `role-switcher`, `workflow-router` |

---

## Meta-Skills (6)

Load these first — they route and compose everything else.

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `workflow-router` | Detects task type (product-from-zero/refinement/bug/feature/review/deploy) → loads correct workflow automatically |
| `role-switcher` | Detects intent → composes role lenses (design audit → master-design + ux-psychology + product-manager) |
| `design-layout` | Layout & structure port — routes to macrostructures, responsiveness, ui-components |
| `design-visual` | Visual design port — routes to genre, motion, composition, readability |
| `design-strategy` | UX strategy & content port — routes to ux-psychology, information-architecture, cro, copywriting |
| `design-interaction` | Interaction & UX patterns port — routes to ux-ui-patterns, ux-patterns-for-developers |

---

## Workflows (9)

| Workflow | Phases |
|---|---|
| `spec-workflow` | constitution → specify → plan → tasks → implement |
| `new-feature-workflow` | plan → design → implement → verify → submit → review |
| `bugfix-workflow` | reproduce → investigate → fix → verify → submit → review |
| `code-review-workflow` | load-context → architecture-check → design-check → logic-check → verdict |
| `deployment-workflow` | pre-deploy → deploy → health-verify → rollback |
| `redesign-workflow` | existing UI/UX surface refinement — audit → spec → prototype/patch → design-review gates → iterate → deliver |
| `product-development-workflow` | discovery → PRD → MVP → spec → implementation → verification → release → deploy → launch → learn |
| `design-refinement` | targeted design fix — failing-gate triage → patch → re-gate → deliver (no full redesign) |
| `skill-doctor` | skill health — audit → triage → fix monoliths/stubs → verify length + gates |

### Workflow entry points

Use broad lifecycle workflows, not surface-specific workflow variants:

| User intent | Start with |
|---|---|
| Build a product from zero, no PRD yet | `product-development-workflow` |
| Refine/redesign/polish an existing landing page, dashboard, app screen, onboarding flow, pricing page, or portfolio | `redesign-workflow` |
| Fix specific failing design gates without full redesign | `design-refinement` |
| Build a new capability in an existing product | `new-feature-workflow` |
| Fix broken behavior or regression | `bugfix-workflow` |
| Review before merge/ship | `code-review-workflow` |
| Deploy/release/rollback | `deployment-workflow` |
| Audit and fix skill files | `skill-doctor` |

Examples:

```bash
hermes chat -s product-development-workflow -q \
  "Develop a digital product for affiliators from zero. Start with discovery and stop after PRD/MVP recommendation for approval."

hermes chat -s redesign-workflow -q \
  "Refine https://pkahfi.com. Start with audit and redesign spec, then stop for approval before producing code."
```

    ↓
product-requirements    ← PRD: goals, non-goals, scope, metrics, acceptance criteria
    ↓
product-development-workflow ← umbrella flow from discovery to launch
    ↓
spec-workflow          ← spec before code

```
workflow-router → detect: product-from-zero? refinement? bug? feature? review? deploy?
role-switcher   → compose: which lenses for this task?
```

## Adapter Pattern

Adapter behavior is a pattern, not a separate official category value today. Use `metadata["ai-native-skills.type"]: skill` plus `metadata["ai-native-skills.implements"]` and `compat/*.compat.yaml` when a skill implements a Native AI Core contract.

```yaml
name: native-ai-runtime-agent
metadata:
  ai-native-skills.type: skill
  ai-native-skills.implements: ai-native-core/contracts/skills/runtime-agent/native-ai-runtime-agent.contract.yaml
```

See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md#adapter-pattern) for details.

---

## Skill Evaluation

```bash
python ai-native-core/scripts/run-eval.py \
  --skill role-switcher \
  --output-file /tmp/agent-output.txt
# verdict: APPLIED | PARTIAL | GHOST
```
